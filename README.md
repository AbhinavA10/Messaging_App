# Messaging_App

## Notes
In order for it to work on my phone on expo go, I had to disable the other networks on my computer so that WiFi was the 1st active one. Then I had to use hotspot from my phone to the computer, then do npm start. Then I scanned the bar code, waited for it to download, then retryed on my phone. Then it worked.

Android emulator does not work


Commands to run:

npm install firebase
npm install -g firebase-tools
npm install @react-navigation/native

Here is my easier solution which works with Anaconda, Miniconda, and even Miniforge:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64149680/how-can-i-activate-a-conda-environment-from-powershell

    Open PowerShell and browse to condabin folder in your Conda installation directory, for example: C:\Users\<username>\anaconda3\condabin
    Run ./conda init powershell in that folder, and reopen the PowerShell.
    Please note: If you encountered ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system, simply run the PowerShell as Administrator and enter the following: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
    Restart the PowerShell and enjoy!

Now you can do:
firebase login
firebase logout (If wanted)
firebase init
firebase init hosting
npx expo export:web
npx serve dist
